You can replicate results by running the gravity3 and gravity4 do-files. 

Source datasets, LPD and union_occ, are unavailable in the Data folder (raw microdata which we cannot distribute ourselves). 

The replication package that we made public starts from the “gravity3” do-file, which already takes as input a dataset that is collapsed at the occupational level. The do-files gravity1 and gravity2 are reported for completeness but cannot be run without the original source datasets LPD and union_occ.

The data underlying Figure 4 can be obtained as follows:

- Run the do-file gravity3_regs.do, which uses the dataset gravity_flows.dta (available in the replication package from the journal).
- The beginning of the do-file gravity4_results.do generates the figure. The underlying data is in reg3.dta (created when running gravity3_regs.do) and corresponds to the values of the variable “estimate” for parm=="angsep".

Estimation is at an annual frequency. Note that reg3.dta has the year-by-year estimates of all the lambdas.
