\noindent The folder "Codes and Data" contains the relevant matlab codes and data for the project "Unobservable Skill Dispersion and Comparative Advantage":

\bigskip
\noindent Matlab code:
\begin{itemize}
\item  "main.m" is the main body code that carries out the calibration, benchmark and counterfactural analysis. 
\item  "equib.m" is the m-function that simulate the bilateral trade flows.
\item  "TFP-A.m" is the m-function that compute the fundamental productivity A's using the score data.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Data:
\begin{itemize}
\item "X1.mat" bilateral trade flows data 
\item "alpha.mat" consumption shares for the differentiated sectors
\item "scores.mat'  raw data with a normalization
\item "nrescore.mat" residual data with a normalization
\item "W.mat"  weights of raw score data 
\item "W-n.mat" weights of residual score data
\item "L.mat"  population
\item "lambda-new" lambda's calibrated by gamma=0.3,0.5 and 0.7 using wage or total compensation data 
\end{itemize}
\noindent Note that the data are sorted alphabetically by the name of countries and industries.

\bigskip
\noindent Results: results in the paper are saved in "total1.mat","total2.mat","total3.mat" for the cases of gamma=0.3,0.5 and 0.7 respectively.
